# Awesome Curated Tools [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)  ![C&B approved](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%20%26%20B-approved-brightgreen.svg)

*A curated list of digital tools we use, ranging from accounting and data science to scientific research and liquid democracy. Commented, connected, by everyone and for everyone !*

## Introduction
We are Connie & Benjamin Chow-Petit, members of a special hacklab called [La Myne](https://lamyne.org).

In contact with La Myne's community, anybody of whatever age, knowledge, coming with an organisation or not, can learn between peers, initiate, join projects, mutualize resources and so on. Each reciprocity agreement is unique. This lead to a wide array of activities, ranging from collaborative meals with kids to international research programs and socio-economical ventures.

This curated list represents our personal state-of-art and exploration in terms of integrated tools, with examples on how we use them. They are meant to be collaborative and connected together.

Your contributions are always welcome !

* ![**C&B +1**](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%26B-%2B1-brightgreen.svg) - Tools that are important to us and go beyond their categories.
* ![**Open Source**](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open-Source-blue.svg) - Tools that are Open Source and/or linked to Open Knowledge.

*Peer training sessions can be organized, so please [drop a line](mailto://team@lamyne.org) if you know or want to know !*
